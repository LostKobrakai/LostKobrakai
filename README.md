# üßë‚Äçüíª Benjamin Milde

Developer focusing on full stack elixir.  
Designer with BA in Mediadesign.

I like to get deeply involved with the communities surrounding the programming languages I work with, getting to know the problems encountered. I really enjoy learning as well as teaching all there is to know about an ecosystem.
